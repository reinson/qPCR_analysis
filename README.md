This script was created as a part of “Python for Data Analysis” course held in University of Tartu. It analyzes a raw qPCR data file (as data.txt) from The Applied Biosystems 7900HT real time PCR machine. We use a microtiter plate with 384 wells for running qPCR. This plate has 16 rows (named A to P) and 24 columns (1 to 24). We routinely run our qPCR’s in horizontally placed triplicates (for example A1, A2, A3 contain technical replicate).

The script uses data from two columns of a results file:  Sample Name (corresponds to the position in the 384 plate -> A1 to P24) and Ct (the value indicating how much DNA of interest was in a given well). Ct values from a results file are first read into a matrix form, based on sample names, representing placement on 384 plate. Then triplicates are analyzed to find averages and standard deviations of three Ct values.  An algorithm is also used to exclude clear outliers from triplicates.
